 So, i am here to share my experiences of quarantine life. </p>
<h2 id="section2">section 2</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"> It ihas been a great pleasure that i am with my family.It was a time when we came more close and shared our opinions. I got a lot of love from my family.My grandmother shared her experiences of life and told some stories&#9996.She also told about how to live life.</p>
<h2 id="section3">section 3</h2>
<p style="text-align:center">
Now I am spending time on farm. Life is so generous in village.We don't worry much about covid 19 outbreak.The pin drop silence of noon  in village is like peace in heaven while the duststorm will compel you take an another bath in night.The nights , spent under the twinkling stars,is more than any other moment.Here the nature is our true friend.</p>
<h2 id="section4">section 4</h2>
<p style="text-align:center">The life in lock down has become completely different. We have become more dependent on ourselves.We spent days with family, without shopping, without parties with friends and without attending any ceremony.
We are having homemade healthy diet  than fast food and junk food.The sky is much clearer than before and water of rivers clearer.The rythm of  nature is more than the sound of machines.We have given much wound to nature so it is recovering itself.We have become more reliable on less services.</p>
<h2 id="section5">section 5</h2>
<p style="text-align:center">
The atmosphere has become so clear that himalayas can be seen from jalandhar.The amount of co2 has redeuced in atmosphere.
Emission of NO2 has nearly stopped because of haltasion of vehicles.</p>
<h2 id="section6">section 6</h2>
<p style="text-align:center">
This quarantine has changed the method of working.We are now able to work for organisation from home. Without much resources we can do efficiently. The educational sector is forwarding from offline  mode to online mode.Students are preferring online study method . The demand of online learning has increased.The use of internet has increased in india.
</p>
<h2 id="section7">section 7</h2>
<p style="text-align:center">
This is the precious time to explore ourself.
In this time we an ask ourself what we want to be and where we want to see ourself after long time.It is time to motivate yourself and time to fill new energy.
