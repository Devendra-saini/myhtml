      <div>  Hi guy,how are you.how is your quarantine life.Hope you are safe with your family.
 So, i am here to share my experiences of quarantine life. </div>
<div style="color:blue";> It ihas been a great pleasure that i am with my family.It was a time when we came more close and shared our opinions. I got a lot of love from my family.My grandmother shared her experiences of life and told some stories.
She also told about how to live life.</div>
 <div>
Now I am spending time on farm. Life is so generous in village.We don't 
worry much about covid 19 outbreak.The pin drop silence of noon  in village is like peace in heaven while the duststorm will compel you take an another bath in night.The nights , spent under the twinkling stars,is more than any other moment.Here the nature is our true friend.</div>
